<p>Zoe Saldana has always been one of my favorite actresses, being a fellow Latina and hailing from New York and all that. I never knew a lot about her private life, but I admired her when I heard that Salanda married Italian artist Marco Perego in a low-key affair, and I know that they’ve kept many details of their relationship very private since then. While the thirst is real, the Guardians of the Galaxy star hasn’t given us too much information about her relationship with her husband, but going by the few bits we have learned, it’s safe to say that Perego and Saldana have a healthy, balanced, and progressive relationship that is worthy of envy.

The actress appears on the cover of the July 2015 issue of InStyle, and in her accompanying interview finally gave us a little insight into life with her husband and their  8-month-old twins — and I am seriously impressed with what she had to say about Perego. She told the magazine that he insisted on taking her last name legally after they wed, a move that is definitely not common. She explained,

I tried to talk him out of it…”If you use my name, you’re going to be emasculated by your community of artists, by your Latin community of men, by the world.”
And what did her new husband have to say about this? “Ah Zoe, I don’t give a s–t.” SWOOOON. I know a little something about the Latin community and it definitely still has strong ties to machismo culture. It is a beautiful anecdote to see that this modern man decided that his wife’s name was worthy enough to take and subsequently pass on to their twin boys, Cy and Bowie, as well. Seriously, husband goals right here. </p>
