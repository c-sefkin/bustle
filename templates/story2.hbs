<p>When it comes to being genetically blessed in the looks department, it’s no secret that Apple and Moses Martin struck some serious gold. (And we mean big time.) After all, when your dad is Chris Martin and your mom is Gwyneth Paltrow, how do you not come out looking like you’re ready for your next Vogue cover? Just this morning, Gwynnie shared a rare post of her two kids on Instagram, where she yet again reminded us all of that fact, plus one more thing we seem to have forgotten: Apple Martin might just be Gwyneth’s doppleganger. (Hear that, Ava Phillippe? It’s time for you to step aside as the reigning champ of celeb mom twinning.)

And I’m not exaggerating here, guys. In the photo, 11-year-old Apple stands outside next to her brother Moses, 9 — whilst holding what might easily be one of the most adorable puppies ever — and smiling back at the camera through a Viper helmet. Sure, we can basically only make out her two eyes and about thismuch of her actual face through said helmet; but trust me, the resulting photo is enough to leave you seriously squinting, and wondering if it’s really Gwyneth in there, after all.</p>
